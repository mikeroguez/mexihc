Lab at the Khoury College of Computer Sciences at Northeastern University. Her research focuses on creating intelligent civic technology to organize collective action for change, which includes battling misinformation and empowering gig and rural works to access better jobs. Before joining Northeastern in 2021, Savage was a tech worker at Intel Labs and Microsoft Bing, and a crowd research worker at Stanford. She has taught or directed at West Virginia University, Carnegie Mellon University, and the University of Washington, focusing on human-computer interaction or human-centered design each time.Much of Savage’s work focuses on expanding real-world applications of AI and human-centered design. To that end, she has created collaborations between federal and local governments, and penned high-level policy briefs within the Federation of American Scientists’ accelerator program. At Khoury College, she teaches human-centered AI, global UX, human–computer interaction, and social computing. Her students have obtained fellowships and internships in both industry and academia, including at Facebook, Twitch, Microsoft, Twitter, and the Oxford Internet Institute. Savage has published in ACM CHI and CSCW, AAAI ICWSM and HCOMP, and the Web Conference; the BCC, The Economist, and the New York Times have covered her work. She is a recipient of grants from the UN and NSF, the Google Anita Borg Scholarship, and MIT Technology Review’s “35 Innovators Under 35” honor. She is also a fellow at the Center for Democracy and Technology, a technical advisor for Mexico’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and a member of ACM SIGCHI’s Latin America Committee.
