Participants will learn to use the basic tools of Tinkercad, design and model 3D parts, assemble the robot, and program it to perform basic movements. The assembled mini robot will serve as a functional prototype for HCI research, especially in areas such as social robotics, tangible interfaces, and education.

Participants will learn to integrate ChatGPT into their R workflows to simplify coding processes, resolve errors, and optimize data analysis tasks. Through practical exercises and real-world examples, attendees will gain experience in using ChatGPT to simulate data, create visualizations, debug code, and interpret results.
