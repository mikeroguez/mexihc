We invite you to read the <a class="uline" href="http://www.sigaccess.org/welcome-to-sigaccess/resources/accessible-writing-guide/">Accessible Writing Guide</a> and <a class="uline" href="http://www.sigaccess.org/welcome-to-sigaccess/resources/accessible-presentation-guide/">the Accessible Presentation Guide</a> published by <a class="uline" href="http://www.sigaccess.org/">ACM SIGACCESS</a>. These guides provide up-to-date recommendations for writing and presenting in the academic accessibility community, as well as nine guidelines for preparing a conference presentation by <a class="uline" href="https://dl.acm.org/profile/81339523613">Kyle Rector</a> to better communicate your message to all audience members. </p><h2 id="accessible-document-author-recommendations">Accessible Document Author Recommendations </h2><p> Accessible documents should be designed with perception and interaction alternatives in mind to ensure comprehension for all readers. If you use Microsoft Word, we recommend following <a class="uline" href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/make-your-word-documents-accessible-to-people-with-disabilities-d9bf3683-87ac-47ea-b91a-78dcacb3c66d">the guide to making your document accessible</a>. Alternatively, Google Docs has published <a class="uline" href="https://support.google.com/docs/answer/6199477?hl=en">tips on making your document or presentation more accessible</a>. </p><p> At a minimum, we suggest: </p><ol><li><strong>The use of built-in heading styles</strong> to improve navigation: this helps people that use <a class="uline" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screen_reader">screen readers</a> make an active reading. </li><li><strong>The use of meaningful text for links:</strong> this improves navigation and readability; avoid “click here” links. </li><li><strong>Add alternative text to images:</strong> this helps people who use a screen reader to perceive visual content; it must be concise. </li><li><strong>In general, avoid tables if possible</strong>. But if you have to use it: <ol type="a"><li><strong>Add alternative text and description to tables:</strong> it helps people to use a screen reader to understand what is important in the table; it must be specific and concise. </li><li><strong>Use tables only for tabular information</strong>, not as document structure. Also, you must configure the table header to appear on subsequent pages. </li></ol></li><li><strong>To add captions for figures and tables</strong>. </li><li><strong>To use simple language</strong>, as possible. </li></ol><p> Adobe has published <a class="uline" href="https://helpx.adobe.com/acrobat/using/create-verify-pdf-accessibility.html">how to create and verify PDF accessibility with Acrobat Pro</a>, and a microsite where you can find <a class="uline" href="https://adobe.lookbookhq.com/acrobataccessibility">Webinar Recordings and Materials on Creating Accessible PDFs</a> that may be helpful too. </p><p> In addition, Apple has some <a class="uline" href="https://support.apple.com/en-my/HT210563">recommendations about accessibility for Pages, Numbers, or Keynote</a>, and for an open-source option here we have <a class="uline" href="https://wiki.documentfoundation.org/Accessibility/Creating_Accessible_LibreOffice_Files">how to create accessible LibreOffice files</a>. </p><h2 id="accessible-slide-author-recommendations">Accessible Slide Author Recommendations</h2><p> Your presentations will be available as part of the digital products generated at MexIHC 2024, therefore is possible that people who will read them, use a screen reader, so we encourage you to consult the <a class="uline" href="http://www.sigaccess.org/welcome-to-sigaccess/resources/accessible-presentation-guide/">Accessible Presentation Guide</a>, published by <a class="uline" href="http://www.sigaccess.org/">ACM SIGACCESS</a>, and how to <a class="uline" href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/make-your-powerpoint-presentations-accessible-to-people-with-disabilities-6f7772b2-2f33-4bd2-8ca7-dae3b2b3ef25">make your Microsoft PowerPoint presentations accessible to people with disabilities</a>. If you work with Google Slides, they have published <a class="uline" href="https://support.google.com/docs/answer/6199477?hl=en">how to make your document or presentation more accessible</a>. </p><p> As minimum accessibility practices you can: </p><ol><li><strong>Give every slide a unique title.</strong> Make this using the built-in title box of the predefined slide templates. </li><li><strong>Add alternative text to images or mark them as decorative images:</strong> this helps people who use a screen reader to perceive visual content; it must be concise. </li><li><strong>Highlight key elements</strong> on images: adding other marks besides color, helps people with color blindness. </li><li><strong>Avoid the use of tables as possible.</strong></li><li> Consider the <strong><a class="uline" href="http://www.sigaccess.org/welcome-to-sigaccess/resources/accessible-presentation-guide/">Accessible Presentation Guide</a></strong>. </li></ol><p> In addition, Apple has some <a class="uline" href="https://support.apple.com/en-my/HT210563">recommendations about accessibility for Pages, Numbers, or Keynote</a>, and for an open-source option here we have <a class="uline" href="https://wiki.documentfoundation.org/Accessibility/Creating_Accessible_LibreOffice_Files">how to create accessible LibreOffice files</a>. </p><h2 id="accessible-video-author-recommendations">Accessible Video Author Recommendations</h2><p> If you need to publish a video, <strong>we suggest you generate closed captions</strong>: this could help people with hearing loss. <a class="uline" href="https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/2734796?hl=en">You can create closed captions automatically on Youtube</a>, then edit them to <strong>use simpler language, as possible</strong>.
