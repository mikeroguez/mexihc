    <h3>What is the Student Design Competition at CLIHC 2023?</h3>

    <p>The Student Design Competition is aimed at meeting three goals:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Provide an opportunity for students from a variety of backgrounds (e.g., computer science, HCI,
            industrial design, product design, visual design, interaction design, entrepreneurship etc.) to
            participate and demonstrate their problem solving and design skills in an international competition with
            their peers.</li>
        <li>Provide an opportunity for students presenting at the design competition to meet with the CLIHC
            community.</li>
        <li>Provide refreshing perspectives on how design teams from different disciplines and different parts of
            the world approach a common design problem.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>The Design Brief: Appropriate Solutions for All</h3>
    <p>
        We ask you to contribute to one (or several) of the 17 Sustainable Development Goals identified by the
        United Nations:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>No Poverty</li>
        <li>Zero Hunger</li>
        <li>Good Health and Well-being</li>
        <li>Quality Education</li>
        <li>Gender Equality</li>
        <li>Clean Water and Sanitation</li>
        <li>Affordable and Clean Energy</li>
        <li>Decent Work and Economic Growth</li>
        <li>Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure</li>
        <li>Reduced Inequality</li>
        <li>Sustainable Cities and Communities</li>
        <li>Responsible Consumption and Production</li>
        <li>Climate Action</li>
        <li>Life Below Water</li>
        <li>Life on Land</li>
        <li>Peace, Justice and Strong Institutions</li>
        <li>Partnerships for the Goals</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        Your problem and your solution needs to be clearly linked to one (or several) of the goals. Engage with and
        involve prospective users. Show that the problem is relevant and the solution actually solves the problem in
        a sustainable way. Look at how others might have tried to solve the problem in the past and come up with a
        new and innovative approach. Assure meeting ethical criteria.
    </p>

    <h3>Student Team Requirements</h3>
    <p>
        Teams must consist of at least two and no more than four students. There is no limit to the number of teams
        that may compete from any given university or organization. However, one student cannot be part of multiple
        teams.
    </p>
    <p>
        Submissions are invited from students at all stages of their university careers, from undergraduate to
        postgraduate level. While not a mandatory requirement, it is strongly encouraged that the teams put forward
        a multidisciplinary and/or multi-national team.
    </p>
    <p>
        The Student Design Competition is for students. Submit proof of student status by sending a note signed by
        your academic supervisor verifying the following information:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Your university</li>
        <li>Whether you were a graduate (i.e., Masters or Doctoral level) or undergraduate (i.e., Bachelor level)
            when the work was done, or confirm that you are either currently registered in an academic program
            full-time, or will return to be a student in the upcoming semester.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Supervising Team Requirements</h3>

    <ul>
        <li>Groups of up to four students with one supervisor.</li>
        <li>Each team must have at least two students and one supervisor.</li>
        <li>Each supervisor can have only one team.</li>
        <li>The supervisor may be a professor or industry professional.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        Academic supervisors, mentors, trainers or people providing additional support must not be co-chairs,
        reviewers or judges for the competition at the same time. <span class="text-danger">Mentors cannot be
            authors of the article</span>.
    </p>
