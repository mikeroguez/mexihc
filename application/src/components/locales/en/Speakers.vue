            Saiph Savage is an assistant professor and director of the Civic A.I. Lab at the Khoury College of Computer
            Sciences at Northeastern University. Her research focuses on creating intelligent civic technology to
            organize
            collective action for change, which includes battling misinformation and empowering gig and rural works to
            access
            better jobs. Before joining Northeastern in 2021, Savage was a tech worker at Intel Labs and Microsoft Bing,
            and a
            crowd
            research worker at Stanford. She has taught or directed at West Virginia University, Carnegie Mellon
            University, and
            the University of Washington, focusing on human-computer interaction or human-centered design each time.Much
            of
            Savage’s work focuses on expanding real-world applications of AI and human-centered design. To that end, she
            has
            created collaborations between federal and local governments, and penned high-level policy briefs within the
            Federation of American Scientists’ accelerator program. At Khoury College, she teaches human-centered AI,
            global UX,
            human–computer interaction, and social computing. Her students have obtained fellowships and internships in
            both
            industry and academia, including at Facebook, Twitch, Microsoft, Twitter, and the Oxford Internet Institute.
            Savage has published in ACM CHI and CSCW, AAAI ICWSM and HCOMP, and the Web Conference; the BCC, The
            Economist, and
            the New York Times have covered her work. She is a recipient of grants from the UN and NSF, the Google Anita
            Borg
            Scholarship, and MIT Technology Review’s “35 Innovators Under 35” honor. She is also a fellow at the Center
            for
            Democracy and Technology, a technical advisor for Mexico’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and a member of ACM
            SIGCHI’s Latin America Committee.
