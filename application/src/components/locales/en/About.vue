    <p>The Eleventh Mexican International Conference on Human-Computer Interaction (MexIHC 2026) marks a very special edition as we celebrate the 20th anniversary of the conference. MexIHC is the premier Human-Computer Interaction conference in Mexico, organized by the <a class="uline" href="https://www.amexihc.org/">Mexican Association on Human-Computer Interaction (AMexIHC)</a>.</p>
    <p>Over the past two decades, MexIHC has fostered the exchange of scientific results, their application in industry, and their impact on evaluation, interface design, education, videogames, mobile and interactive applications, and related areas. This milestone edition not only continues this tradition of excellence but also celebrates twenty years of building and strengthening the HCI community in Mexico and beyond.</p>
    <p>The main objective of MexIHC 2026 is to enable the exchange of cutting-edge research, innovative practices, and interdisciplinary perspectives that advance the state of the art in Human-Computer Interaction. This year's conference is organized by lecturers and researchers from the HCI community in Mexico, reaffirming our collective commitment to academic collaboration and community growth.</p>
