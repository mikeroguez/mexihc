    <p>
        We invite practitioners, researchers, and students to submit their work to the poster track at CLIHC 2023.
        Posters provide a great opportunity for academics and practitioners to get valuable feedback on early-stage
        work and discuss potential collaborations. Posters must present work-in-progress, preliminary results,
        small-scale studies, late-breaking scientific and professional news showing promise, a demonstration of a
        technical tool, etc. Contributions will be exhibited in a poster session during the CLIHC conference. Papers
        submitted to the poster track can be written either in English, Spanish, or Portuguese and must be written
        in the form of self-contained short research papers.
    </p>
